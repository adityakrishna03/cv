<h3><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></h3>

Yes, I am coauthor of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>, along with <a
href="http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/~cel">Charles Leiserson</a>, <a
href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest">Ron Rivest</a>, and <a
href="http://www.ieor.columbia.edu/~cs2035">Cliff Stein</a>.  For MIT
Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about <a
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/1990-introduction-algorithms">the
secret to writing a best-selling textbook</a>.

<p>

Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about
<i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>:

<dl>
  <dt> <i>Will there be a fourth edition?  If so, when will it be available?</i>

  <dd> The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022.  The <a
			 href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-fourth-edition">MIT Press site for the book</a> has links to sites that sell it.

			 <p>

	<dt> <a name="errata"></a><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i>
	<dd> For the fourth edition, we maintain an <a
			 href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata
			 page</a> that allows you to list errors by date, by page, or by
			 severity.

			 <p>

			 For the second and third editions, we maintained an <a
       href="clrs-bugs/bugs-3e.php">errata page</a> that allows you to list errors
       by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer.  There is even
       an incremental update feature, allowing you to list only the
       errors posted since the last date that you asked about.  We
       stopped logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so
       that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.

	<dt> <i>How do I report errors?</i>
  <dd> First, please visit the <a
       href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata
       page</a> to verify that the error has not been reported
       already.  Once you have determined that you have found an
       unreported error, send email to <a
       href="mailto:clrs-bugs@mit.edu">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a>.  We will
			 respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.

			 <p>

			 Please use the <a
			 href="mailto:clrs-bugs@mit.edu">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a> address
			 <em>only</em> to report errors.  If you have a suggestion or a
			 question, please contact me directly at <a
			 href="mailto:thc@cs.dartmouth.edu">thc@cs.dartmouth.edu</a>.

			 <p>

  <dt> <i>Do you correct errors?</i>
	<dd> Yes.  Each time a new printing is produced, it contains
       corrections to all errors that have been reported by that time.
       The <a
       href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata
       page</a> indicates in which printing each error was corrected.
       </p>

	<dt> <i>What is the difference between an edition and a printing?</i>
  <dd> Each edition is a major revision of the book.  The first
       edition of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> was published in
       1990, the second edition came out in 2001, the third edition
       appeared in 2009, and the fourth edition is from 2022.  A
       printing for a given edition occurs when the publisher needs to
       manufacture more copies.  As the answer to the previous
       question indicates, we have been correcting errors in each
       printing of the second and third editions.  We perturb the
       pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a
       new printing.  <p>

  <dt> <a name="solutions"></a><i>Can I get solutions to exercises and
       problems?</i>
	<dd> As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for
       a select set of exercises and problems.  They are posted at the
       MIT Press website.

       <p>

       We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is
       available only to instructors who have adopted the book for
       course use.  The manual has lecture notes and solutions to
       additional exercises and problems, but by no means all of them.
       (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and
       problems would take somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.)
       You'll need to contact the MIT Press for passwords to access
       the manual site and the files.  (Contact information is at the
       MIT Press website.) You cannot get the passwords from me or
       from any of my coauthors.

       <p>

       <strong>I will not respond to requests for the manual or for
       solutions.</strong>

       <p>

  <dt> <i>How can I typeset pseudocode to make it look like the pseudocode
       in the book?</i>

	<dd> I created three packages for LaTeX2e.  The
       <code>clrscode</code> package gives you pseudocode in the style
       of the second edition, the <code>clrscode3e</code> package
       gives you pseudocode in the style of the third edition, and the
       <code>clrscode4e</code> package gives you pseudocode in the
       style of the fourth edition.

			 <p>

			 You can download the <code>clrscode4e</code> package <a
			 href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/clrscode4e.sty">here</a>
			 and its documentation <a
			 href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/clrscode4e.pdf">here</a>.

			 <p>

			 You can download either
			 <code>clrscode</code> or <code>clrscode3e</code> and its documentation by clicking <a
       href="clrscode">here</a>.  The <code>clrscode</code> package is
       also on the
       <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/?filename=macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/&preferredCTAN=tug.ctan.org&action=/tools/filesearch&catstring=macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/">CTAN website</a>.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>Can you send me a free copy of the book?  Can you send me
       an electronic copy of the book?  Can you help me with this
       algorithms problem I have?</i>
  <dd> No, no, and sorry, but no.  You can purchase an electronic copy
       of the book, however: Amazon.com now sells a version of
       <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> for Kindle.
       <p>

  <dt> <i>I see that there are two versions of the second edition,
       one published by the MIT Press and one published by McGraw-Hill.
       How do the two versions differ?</i>
  <dd> Other than minor differences in the covers, the book content
       in the two versions is identical.  McGraw-Hill also includes a CD
       (see the next question).
       <p>

  <dt> <i>Are the algorithms in the book implemented in a real programming
       language, rather than just pseudocode?</i>
  <dd> In the second edition, McGraw-Hill included with the book a CD
       containing Java implementations of all the algorithms in Parts
       I-VI.  The CD also has Javadoc-generated web pages that
       document all the classes.
       We did not update the Java implementations for the third
       edition.  <p>

			 For the fourth edition, we have made available on the MIT Press
			 website <a
			 href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/clrsPython.zip">implementations
			 in Python</a> by Linda Xiao and me.

<h3><i>Algorithms Unlocked</i></h3>

<i>Algorithms Unlocked</i> is a gentler, less technical, entry into
algorithms than <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>.  It contains some
mathematics, but not nearly as deep as in <i>Introduction to
Algorithms</i>.  The Amazon site for the book is <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Unlocked-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262518805/">here</a>,
and the MIT Press site is <a
href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-unlocked">here</a>.

<p>

I maintain an <a href="au-bugs">errata page</a> for <i>Algorithms
Unlocked</i>.  If you find an error in the book and it's not already
in the <a href="au-bugs">errata page</a>, send email to <a
href="mailto:algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu">algorithms-unlocked@mit.edu</a>.
(The email address in the preface of the book is incorrect&mdash;the
first known error in the book.)

<p>

<i>Algorithms Unlocked</i> is the <a href="AU-10K.html">10,000th book
title published by MIT Press</a>.

among "Noted residents, past and present" in the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanside,_New_York">Wikipedia page
on Oceanside, NY</a>, but someone removed me from the Oceanside page
with the notation "Removed notable people who barely lived there or
people who are not notable."  Since I lived in Oceanside for the first
18 years of my life, I can only conclude that I am not notable.

My wife, Nicole, and I took a <a href="bbqtour">Barbecue tour</a> of
the South in August 1998.

<p>

In July 2010, I rollerbladed the <a
href="https://friendsofcdatrails.org/trail-of-the-coeur-dalenes/">Trail
of the Coeur D'Alenes</a>, a 71.4-mile-long paved rail trail in the
Idaho panhandle.  Accompanied by my friend, Paul Daro, who also
bladed, and Nicole, who biked, we went 42 miles the first day and the
balance the second day.  Here is a <a
href="images/Plummer.jpg">photo</a> of the three of us at the start of
the first day, at the western trailhead in Plummer, Idaho, (on the
Coeur D'Alene reservation) and here is a <a
href="images/Mullan.jpg">photo</a> of Paul and me at the start of the
second day, at the eastern trailhead in Mullan, Idaho.  We met <a
href="images/CDA-moose.jpg">this fellow</a> on the trail during the
first day.  <a href="CDA.html">This page</a> has some rough videos
that Paul took.

<p>

I was the Ice Man for the <a href="http://www.mdbbq.com">Maryland
State Barbecue Championship</a> in 2003, 2004, and 2005.  Here's a <a
href="ICE.jpg">photo</a> from the 2005 contest of me with a
quad-runner full of 40-pound bags of ice.  The photo was taken by the
<a href="http://www.dizzypigbbq.com/">Dizzy Pigs</a>, the 2005 and
2006 Grand Champions.  Even with the megaphone, I was pretty hoarse by
the end of the second day.  The Dizzy Pigs, and all the other
contestants, can explain why.

<p>

I was <a href="http://www.kcbs.us">Kansas City Barbeque Society</a>
Certified Barbeque Judge number 62145.  (I have purposely let my KCBS
membership lapse.)  My first contest as a certified judge was the 2011
Maryland State Championship in Bel Air.  <a
href="images/Judging%20chicken.JPG">Here</a> is a photo of me just
starting to judge the first item, chicken.  And <a

five entries each of chicken, pork ribs, pork, and beef brisket.

In September 1997, Nicole and I finished hiking all 48 of the
4000-foot peaks in the <a href="http://hikethewhites.com/">White
